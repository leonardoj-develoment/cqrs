# Hexagonal Architecture. CQRS. Template.

## What is Hexagonal Architecture Template?

This is a template built with Hexagonal Architecture.   
Here is defined the project scaffolding and some basic dependencies to make it easy for devs to create new projects.        
There is also a brief description of Hexagonal Architecture and **how we implement it**, but is not the intention of this Template to be a guide or post talking about that, 
if you want to know more there are videos of our Experts talking about that. 

## Motivation

Our motivation is to provide development teams with solid tools and an architecture to build **high-speed solutions** without worrying about scaffolding or tooling.

## How to work with this repo?

This repository should help you start faster a new Java application using the Hexagonal Architecture.
You'll find a README in each folder, explaining what should be there and what not.
Also, there will be an example code showing the interaction between layers.
